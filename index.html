            Hello, here is a quick intro about my programming journey and this website. My web development journey
            started at 25th
            April, 2022 with NEWTON SCHOOL and before that I watched coding tutroials of JAVA and DSA from Code With
            Harry youtube channel.
            I am currently exploring my coding skills with the help of Newton School by compeleting course as full Stack
            Web Developer.

        <p class="para2">
        <ul>
            <li>It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.</li>
            <li>We’ve all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That’s who we
                really
                are.</li>
            <li>I am what I am, an’ I’m not ashamed. ‘Never be ashamed,’ my ol’ dad used ter say, ‘there’s some who’ll
                hold it
                against you, but they’re not worth botherin’ with.</li>
            <li>The ones that love us never really leave us. You can always find them in here.</li>
            <li>If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.
            </li>
            <li>To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.</li>
            <li>Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth.</li>
            <li>Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.</li>
            <li>Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect.</li>

            I like to read novels and exploring world. Infact I never watch a single movie of HarryPotter, insted of
            that I read all novels of him.<br>

            moments of meteorid.<br>

            cities.<br>
